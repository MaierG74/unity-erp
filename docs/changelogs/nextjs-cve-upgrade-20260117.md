# Next.js CVE-2025-55182 Upgrade - January 17, 2026

## Issue Summary
Netlify blocked deploys because the project was using a Next.js version affected by CVE-2025-55182. The deploy failed at the server function upload step with a 400 error, and Netlify refused to upload the `___netlify-server-handler` until Next.js was upgraded to a patched release.

## Root Cause
`package.json` pinned Next.js to `^15.1.4`, which is flagged by Netlify as vulnerable. Netlify enforces the block to prevent deployments with known critical vulnerabilities.

## Resolution
- Upgraded Next.js to **16.1.3** (`next@16.1.3`).
- Updated `package-lock.json` to reflect the new dependency tree.

## Files Updated
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`

## Deployment Notes
- Netlify should accept the deployment once the updated dependencies are pushed to `main`.

## Testing
- Not run locally (expect Netlify build to validate the upgrade).
