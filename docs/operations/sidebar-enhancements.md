# Sidebar Enhancements Log

_Updated: 2025-09-20_

## Recent Changes

- Added custom tooltips that appear when the sidebar is collapsed so users still see full section names while hovering or tabbing through icons.
- Introduced a subtle vertical gradient background to the sidebar to give it more visual depth.
- Refined navigation link styling with rounded edges, animated icon hover states, and focus outlines for better accessibility feedback.
- Applied a richer active-state treatment using a primary-colored gradient and shadow to highlight the current section.

## Ideas for Future Iterations

- Offer personalization options (e.g., light/dark sidebar themes or accent color selection).
- Add optional quick shortcuts or pinned links at the bottom for commonly used destinations.
- Introduce section dividers or headings once the navigation grows beyond the current categories.
- Consider mini analytics or status badges (e.g., outstanding tasks count) beside key menu items.
