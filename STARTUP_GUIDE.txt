# How to Start the Unity ERP App (with Troubleshooting)

1. If starting for the first time or after dependency changes, clean up the environment:
   - Clear npm cache: npm cache clean --force
   - Remove node_modules directory: rm -rf node_modules
   - Remove package-lock.json: rm package-lock.json
2. Install dependencies (with verbose output for troubleshooting):
   - npm install --verbose
3. If you see 'Cannot find module react', install React explicitly:
   - npm install react react-dom
4. Start the development server:
   - npm run dev
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

This process ensures a clean environment and resolves common issues with missing dependencies or stuck installs.
